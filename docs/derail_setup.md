## Solar Panel

For proper operation, the solar panel must receive direct sunlight from **10:00 AM** to **3:00 PM** without obstruction from structures, railcars, or vegetation.  
For installations in the USA, the solar panel should face **south** for optimal efficiency.

* Observe the site and ensure that the solar panel will receive sun once installed.

* Two locations with **1/4"-20** threaded stud patterns are provided for mounting the solar panel and light assemblies.

* The solar panel must be mounted on the stud pattern closest to the side of the device that will receive the most sunlight.  

![Solar panel placement](assets/solar_orientation.jpg){: style="height:300px;width:auto"}  
*Correct solar panel orientation and placement.*

**Step 1: Measure Tilt Angle**

The optimal tilt angle for solar panel efficiency depends on the latitude of the installation site.

* Use a maps or GPS app to measure the site latitude.

* Set the tilt angle equal to the latitude.

!!! example
    Latitude 38.2° → Tilt angle **38.2°**

**Step 2: Seasonal adjustments:**

* Winter: **Latitude + 15°**  

* Summer: **Latitude – 15°**  

* Spring/Fall: **Latitude only**  

!!! example
    Spring/Fall tilt angle = **38.2°**    
    Winter tilt angle = 38.2 + 15 = **53.2°**  
    Summer tilt angle = 38.2 – 15 = **23.2°**  

![Solar panel tilt by season](assets/solar_tilt_chart.png){: style="height:300px;width:auto"}  
*Recommended tilt angles by season.*

## Turning on the System

![Derail Charger Connected](assets/solar_control.jpg){:: style="height:280px;width:auto"}



**Step 1: Battery Connection**

!!! warning "Polarity Matters" 
    Reversing battery polarity (red to **–** or black to **+**) can permanently damage the controller and board and is not covered by warranty.
    Use a multimeter to pre-check the battery’s voltage and polarity at the terminals before attaching any leads.



**Step 2: Confirm Readiness** 

* Identify terminals and leads:

  * Battery positive (**+**) terminal.

  * System leads: red = positive (**+**)
 


**Step 3: Connect the Positive Lead**

!!! warning "Loose Connection Hazard"
    A wire that is not fully secured can cause overheating, arcing, or system failure.

* Insert the spade connector fully into the screw terminal.  
   - Ensure that no bare conductor is exposed outside the terminal housing.  
   - The insulation should come right up to the terminal opening.

* Turn the screw clockwise until the wire is firmly clamped in place.  
   - The wire should not shift or pull out with gentle tugging.  
   - Do **not** overtighten—this may damage the screw or deform the wire.

* Verify by gently pulling on the wire. If it moves, retighten the screw.
   
* Confirm that no bare wire is exposed.



**Step 4: Verify Power Indicators**

* Look for the indicator lights on the charge controller and on the main board to confirm the sensor is receiving power.

* If indicators do not light:

  * Recheck polarity and terminal tightness



**Step 5: Support**

* If the system still does not power on, stop and contact TXRX support for assistance. Do not modify wiring beyond the procedures in this manual.
