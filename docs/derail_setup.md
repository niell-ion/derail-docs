### Clear Zone

The derail sensor requires a level installation surface and a clear zone around the device. Ensure that the following clearance dimensions are present before proceeding.

**1. Measure Site Clearance**

!!! warning "Clearance Warning"
    Installation at sites not meeting the clearance requirements listed below is prohibited.

!!! note "Minimum Clearance Dimensions"
    * Distance to rail: 42 in.
* Vertical clearance: 27 in.
* Horizontal clearance: 22 in.

**2. Check that Site is Level** 

* Use a level to measure the elevation of the ground from front to back.

* From the edge of the rail to a point 42 in. straight back, the elevation must be level ±6 in.

### Solar Panel

For proper operation, the solar panel must receive direct sunlight from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM without obstruction from structures, railcars, or vegetation.

* Two mounting points with 1/4"-20 threaded studs are provided for the solar panel and light.

* The solar panel must be mounted on the stud pattern on the side that receives the most sunlight.

**Solar Panel Tilt Angle**

* Measure the latitude of the installation site.

* Set the tilt angle equal to the latitude.

!!! example
    Latitude 38.2° → Tilt angle 38.2°

**Seasonal adjustments:**
