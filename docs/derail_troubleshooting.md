## Mechanical Issues

!!! tip
    Clean solar panels using mild soap, water, and a soft cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive pads.

**Sensor positioning issues**  
* Check that the sensor is correctly aligned with the target area.  
* Ensure the mounting bracket is firmly attached and not vibrating.  
* Verify that no debris or obstacles are blocking the sensor’s field of view.  

**Solar panel issues**  
* Inspect for dirt, dust, or shading that may reduce efficiency.  
* Confirm the solar panel is securely mounted and angled toward the sun.  
* Check for cracks, water damage, or loose framing hardware.

## Electrical Issues

!!! warning "Electrical Hazard"
    Disconnect the battery before performing electrical checks. Use insulated tools and avoid shorting terminals.

**1. Charging issues**  

* Measure battery voltage with a digital multimeter.
* Confirm that the solar panel output is within expected range (typically **17–21 V**).  
* Inspect fuses and replace if blown.  

**2. Connection issues**  

* Ensure all screw terminals are fully tightened (see [Terminal Wiring](derail_setup.md#turning-on-the-system)).  
* Check for corrosion on connectors; clean with a dry brush if necessary.  
* Verify correct polarity (**+** to **+**, **–** to **–**).  

**3. Sensor issues**  

* Confirm power is reaching the sensor (LED indicators active, if applicable).  
* Inspect the sensor cable for cuts, kinks, or wear.  
* Re-seat the connector firmly at both ends.

## Next Steps

* If the issue persists after following these checks, contact **TXRX Technical Support** with your system serial number and maintenance log.  
* See [Maintenance](../docs/derail_maintenance.md) for preventive care guidelines.
